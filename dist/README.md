this isn't really a distribution folder as you would expect.

nothing is really in place just yet and at this moment this folder belongs to this creature [![surge](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*0sps7zugC50qAYlM6-8atA.png)](http://paradise-edge-second.surge.sh/)

kindly serving files from this folder at [paradise-edge-second.surge.sh](http://paradise-edge-second.surge.sh/)

---

just as a side note i would really recommend using [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) for quick deployment of static files for whatever purposes you might need.

it's dead easy, see for yourself:
