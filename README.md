don't forget to take a look at the artwork and subscribe to updates about his promising cyberpunk production

in case you like the graphics and decide to fork the repo please keep in mind I do not own the graphics and you need to contact the creator for any information about the licence under which they were published

i strongly recommend forking and modification  only for personal use or in fact not at all

on the other hand all code is added by [rafszul](https://github.com/rafszul) is licenced under gplv30 with some dependencies in form of adobe open licence which you can find in one of the folders 

all in all you are welcome to copy, modify and distribute the code and i will be very keen on seeing potential mods and addons
